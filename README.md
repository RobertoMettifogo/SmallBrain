I started this project as an assignment form my core trainer in DBGA game programming course.
I had a lot of fun managing rock spawn and animation setup.
The game is controlled by two main scripts:
  GameController = Which control lives, score, difficulty based on score level and game pausa/unpause.
    difficult level increase rock spawnrate, percentage of operations (Sum,Sub,Mult;Div).
  SpawnController = Responsible of rock prefab spawning, random operation pick base on percentage.
I ll keep polish and improve my project :)
